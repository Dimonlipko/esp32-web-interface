# About
This repository hosts the source code for the Web Interface for the Huebner inverter, and derivated projects:
* [OpenInverter Sine (and FOC) firmware](https://github.com/jsphuebner/stm32-sine)
* [Vehicle Control Unit for Electric Vehicle Conversion Projects](https://github.com/damienmaguire/Stm32-vcu)
* [OpenInverter buck or boost mode charger firmware](https://github.com/jsphuebner/stm32-charger)
* [OpenInverter non-grid connected inverter](https://github.com/jsphuebner/stm32-island)
* [BMS project firmware](https://github.com/jsphuebner/bms-software)
* ...

It is written with the Arduino development environment and libraries.

# Usage
To use the web interface 2 things are needed :
* You need to have a computer on the same WiFi network as the board,
* You need to 'browse' the web interface page.

## Wifi network
There are 2 possibilities:
* Either you connect to an Access Point generated by the board. The default name for this access point is 'ESP-xxxxx' but can be customized. In that case, the board will have a fixed IP address of `192.168.4.1` (and will be reachable on http://192.168.4.1/)
* Or you can configure the board to join your own WiFi network ; and in that case you may need to tweak your network configuration to provide a fixed address to the board (not necessary).

## Reaching the board
The board announces itself to the world using mDNS protocol (aka Bonjour, or Rendezvous, or Zeroconf), so you may be able to reach the board using a local name of `inverter.local`.
So first try to reach it on http://inverter.local/

# Hardware
The web interface has been initially designed to run on ESP8266 boards, such as:
* [Olimex MOD-WIFI-ESP8266](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP8266/MOD-WIFI-ESP8266/open-source-hardware)

(Pay attention to the SPI flash chip on your board: some need a special mode `QOUT` instead of `QIO` for programming)

You can buy pre-programmed boards:
* [OpenInverter shop](https://openinverter.org/shop/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=56)
* [EVBMW Shop](https://www.evbmw.com/index.php/evbmw-webshop/vcu-boards/wifi-progged) (Note : you can choose between OpenInverter or Lexus VCU firmware version )

# Firmware
You can find pre-compiled versions of the firmware on the [OpenInverter forum](https://openinverter.org/forum), or can compile it yourself
by following the [instructions below](#development).

# Flashing / Upgrading
## Wirelessly
If your board is already programmed with this esp8266-web-interface firmware, or with a firmware that has either ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer or ArduinoOTA components compiled in (it may be the case with the default firmware when you buy a new module), and if you can already reach it (WiFi + network); then you can use one of these approachs:

* Using ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer component
  * Either go to http://inverter.local/update and upload the binary firmware file
  * Or use this command line `curl -F "image=@firmware.bin" inverter.local/update`
* Using the ArduinoOTA component
  * Use the `espota.py` tool (available in the Arduino tools) to upload either a binary firmware file, or a binary filesystem file:
    * Firmware: `python ..../Arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/3.0.2/tools/espota.py -i esp8266-761bb8.local --progress  --file firmware.bin`
    * Filesystem: `python ..../Arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/3.0.2/tools/espota.py -i esp8266-761bb8.local --spiffs --progress --file spiffs.bin`
  * Using your development environment (see the [instructions below](#development))

## Wired
If your board is new and unprogrammed, or if you want to fully re-program it, you'll need to have a wired connection between your computer and the board.
Assuming you're using the original Olimex board, you'll need :
* A 3.3v capable USB / Serial adapter
* the following connections:  

Pin#  | ESP8266 Board Function | USB / Serial adapter
----- | ---------------------- | --------------------
1     | +3.3v input            | (Some adapters provide a +3.3v output, you can use it)
2     | GND                    | GND
3     | RXD input              | TXD output
4     | TXD output             | RXD input

Then you would use any of the the [development tool below](#development) ; or the `esptool.py` tool to upload either a binary firmware file, or a binary filesystem file.

# Documentations
* [Openinverter Web Interface Protocol](PROTOCOL.md)

# Development
You can choose between the following tools:

## Arduino
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) is an easy-to-use desktop IDE, which provides a quick and integrated way to develop and update your board.
* [Initial setup](doc/ARDUINO_IDE_setup.md)
* [Day to day usage](doc/ARDUINO_IDE_usage.md)
